.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wast
is a simple auto cpu frequencer that only changes two things: the governor and
turbo boost state; depending on the cpu load, system load and the temperature.
Machines that have a battery and most of the time depend on it are the target,
turbo boost state; depending on the cpu load, system load and the temperature.
turbo boost state; depending on the cpu load, system load and the temperature.
Machines that have a battery and most of the time depend on it are the target,
but since it reduces the power consumption in general it can be beneficial
anyway, in theory. It needs root access to write to the system filesystem.
